								<p>ABAQUS-MATLAB Interface:
								</p>
								<p>This is the most difficult part of this project which involves interfacing the MATALB file “RUN_ABAQUS_BELLOW_VJ.m’ to our ABAQUS GUI via the python script. The python script we have for generating the CAE files is named ‘final_AMDS_finger.py’. The first part of the code is written to import the ‘Vara_ronn.py’ file that has the 4 state variables and pressure value. The state variables are the coordinates for the points with which we sketch the finger in the ABAQUS (mentioned in the Design page of this website). This code has 4 sections of code: extrude boss sketch, extrude cut sketch, material modelling/interaction/loading steps/job, and lastly post processing step which will create a ‘abaqus.rpt’ file (report file) that has the deflection values of the inflated finger. We can check the working of the script by opening a new ABAQUS GUI (CAE) and then going to File -> Run Script to ensure that everything is good and we get a report file generated at the end. We recommend saving all the file to the ABAQUS directory in our computer. In our case, the directory was C:/temp since all the job files (.odb, .rec,.dat,.inp) are automatically created by the system command.
									After ensuring the two python files are working, we then move to the MATLAB files. To call ABAQUS, we use the MATLAB system command, this command allows me to write commands directly to windows command terminal. As we mentioned above, this command opens the CAE and executes the final finger python script, internally this script reads the state values from the Vara file, and outputs the abaqus.rpt which has the deformed values. The Video below shows a single call to ABAQUS modelling a random geometry that is formed using the random parent value put by the NSGA code.									 </p>
