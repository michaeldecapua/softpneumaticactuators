								<p>ABAQUS-MATLAB Interface:
								</p>
								<p>This is the most difficult part of this project which involves interfacing the MATALB file “RUN_ABAQUS_BELLOW_VJ.m’ to our ABAQUS GUI via the python script. The python script we have for generating the CAE files is named ‘final_AMDS_finger.py’. The first part of the code is written to import the ‘Vara_ronn.py’ file that has the 4 state variables and pressure value. The state variables are the coordinates for the points with which we sketch the finger in the ABAQUS (mentioned in the Design page of this website). This code has 4 sections of code: extrude boss sketch, extrude cut sketch, material modelling/interaction/loading steps/job, and lastly post processing step which will create a ‘abaqus.rpt’ file (report file) that has the deflection values of the inflated finger. We can check the working of the script by opening a new ABAQUS GUI (CAE) and then going to File -> Run Script to ensure that everything is good and we get a report file generated at the end. We recommend saving all the file to the ABAQUS directory in our computer. In our case, the directory was C:/temp since all the job files (.odb, .rec,.dat,.inp) are automatically created by the system command.
									After ensuring the two python files are working, we then move to the MATLAB files. To call ABAQUS, we use the MATLAB system command, this command allows me to write commands directly to windows command terminal. As we mentioned above, this command opens the CAE and executes the final finger python script, internally this script reads the state values from the Vara file, and outputs the abaqus.rpt which has the deformed values. The Video below shows a single call to ABAQUS modelling a random geometry that is formed using the random parent value put by the NSGA code.									 </p>
								<p>NSGA-II overview: </p>
								<p>To run our optimization, we implemented a NSGA-II algorithm with a population size of X and to run Y generations. The state vector size was 4 and holds the coordinates of the points to create the geometry of the actuator. These 4 control points have the limitations on where they can be, which can be done by specifying the maximum and minimum values. When the algorithm tries to place a point outside of this range, the value is reset to the min or max allowed. These points are used to write the ABAQUS script that build the geometry, applies load and runs the simulation. 
									One challenge here is to update the script for the surface selection of the inner chambers where the pressure load is applied. This is because the cut extrude thickness changes as it is a state variable. We can resolve this by shifting the reference XY plane (which is to be created for the cut extrude sketch for the chambers) to the origin. We first created the ABAQUS CAE file through the manual GUI steps. After submitting the job, we converted the .jnl file (which is generated as soon as we save the CAE file) into python file by changing the ABAQUS.jnl to .py, took the script into our ‘final_AMDS_finger.py ‘ file and added extra lines so that it reads the Vara file. This helped in ensuring that the surface selection in the viewport will be updated each time the geometry is changed during iterations.
									This is a good way for others to use these codes in case they have an entirely different structure whose python script they can get easily from the .jnl files. Now, those who will use the ABAQUS student version, they have to use the MACROS file (run the macros recording from File -> Macro Manager when creating a job manually in ABAQUS).
									</p>
								<p>Limitations and future work:</p>
								<p>One of the limitations right now is that the ABAQUS.rpt only contains the deflection values. Now, we intend to create a fitness function that will maximize the bending and minimize the prescribed pressure. Although we did create a history output that contains the pressure values as well as the deflection values, the python script was unable to create the report file via history output. It only allowed us to create .rpt files using field output variables which does not have the pressure change. So, for now, our pressure is constant and the shape of the finger changes based on the maximum deflection only. 
									In near future, we will try to evolve our fitness functions (bending angle and pressure) and update the NSGA code subsequently. We will even add a blocking force fitness function and will try to maximize that as well. Hopefully, after this, we will try to optimize actuators with complex geometries for future research work.
