								<p>Soft Robotics is a major booming research field in recent years in medical devices and space exploration,
									 with a large number of inventions coming out on a day-to-day basis. Soft robotics include developing parts
									  and assemblies with flexible materials (generally done through additive manufacturing like 3D prototyping), 
									  and flexible electronics. Soft robotics provide flexibility, with proper design, can provide better strength
									   for reduced infill material, and can improve safety when working in close contact with humans. The soft 
									   robotics field is growing even more with the development of robotics which is getting inspired by biological
									    animals, mimicking their body characteristics, to provide better designs. They are more adaptable and 
										flexible than traditional designs.</p>
								<p>One of the main applications of soft robotics is in mimicking the human hand. Our human hand is a naturally
									 soft part that can handle different sizes, shapes, and structures and can hold objects from delicate, 
									 soft objects to hard objects. There are numerous types of traditional grippers on the market, powered by 
									 joints and motors, but doing a soft robotic human hand would provide more flexibility to the soft robotic 
									 hand. also holds promise for better prosthetics, robots to interact directly with people or with fragile
									  objects, or robots to squeeze into tight spaces. </p>

								<p>FIG 2: A sample flexible soft robotic design with pressure control</p></center>
								<p> In this project, we are trying to design a soft robotic hand and incorporate the Genetic Algorithm technique
									 in order to provide better optimization, as in optimizing the weight and maximizing the bending angle. This
									  research area has a set of variables to evaluate and optimize compared to rigid bodies. New variables of 
									  study for optimization are to be looked at for this study. For this, we are utilizing the air inside the 
									  robotic arm and varying the pressure to control the bending angle. NSGA II method has been incorporated in 
									  order to provide the best-optimized design for the robotic arm (with the base design we have created in 
									  ABAQUS).
